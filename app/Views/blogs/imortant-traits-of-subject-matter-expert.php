									<strong>What is subject Matter Expert?</strong>
									<p>No one is born an expert. If you want to become a subject
										matter expert (SME), you have to start somewhere. With the
										passion for a specific subject and a desire for continuous
										learning, you should consider a SME role. It not only
										increases your personal value but also bolsters your company's
										value in the market.</p>
									<br />
									<p>Are you wondering: What is a subject matter expert? And what
										do they do? A subject matter expert has a deep knowledge of a
										specific process, function or technology (or, a combination of
										all three). An SME is considered an authority on a certain
										topic – not only educated on the subject but has the capacity
										to share their knowledge with other interested parties. This
										information is important to your company because it gives it a
										competitive edge.</p>
									<br /> <strong>Traits of Subject Matter Expert</strong> <br />
									<strong> Build A Foundation Of Knowledge</strong>
									<p>o become an expert, you must first be a novice. Start by
										educating yourself on the subject of interest. You won't be
										able to fake it until you make it on this one. You'll be
										sharing information with other professionals in the field.
										Therefore, you MUST know the topic if you want to be
										recognized as a subject matter expert.</p>
									<br /> <strong>Continue Educating Yourself</strong>
									<p>It's one thing to have majored in a particular area, but you
										need to know the latest happenings in the space to have a shot
										at becoming an SME. Attend conferences, participate in Twitter
										chats and subscribe to industry publications. You have to
										constantly stay updated with the latest information.</p>
									<br /> <strong>Try Out Your Own Ideas</strong>
									<p>To make it as a SME, you should have the ability to come up
										with your own ideas in the space. The only way to do this
										effectively (and not get busted as a fraud) is to completely
										immerse yourself in the subject. Make sure you test out these
										ideas before you advise others to put them into practice.</p>
									<br /> <strong> Participate On Social Media</strong>
									<p>You will be able to follow other authorities on social media
										and follow relevant hashtags to keep a pulse on the subject.
										Also, leverage social media to market your expertise. Get
										involved in Twitter Chats or tweet along with live webcasts.
										Start by sharing reputable information on the subject before
										interjecting your opinions.</p>
									<br /> <strong> Share Your Subject Matter Expertise</strong>
									<p>Beyond social media, you can start a blog or a podcast to
										share your knowledge and ideas regularly. Take advantage of
										technology to get your message out. A YouTube channel is
										another option. If you're not ready to commit to regular
										content, try hosting or co-hosting a one-off webcast. Be open
										to questions so others can start to trust your information.</p>
									<br /> <strong> Be A Decisionmaker</strong>
									<p>You'll have to work your way up to this one, but real-life
										practice will be the best continuing education you can get. If
										you have the authority in your job to affect the outcomes of
										major decisions, you're on your way to SME stardom. Being an
										influencer will strengthen your value as a subject matter
										expert – and others will notice.</p>
									<br /> <strong> Be Genuine</strong>
									<p>Your company may recognize your knowledge is valuable to
										gain recognition in the market or even garner more sales
										interest. But, to remain a go-to on your topic of choice, you
										need to remain neutral. You want to be looked at as a true
										authority on the subject and not someone who is easily
										persuaded by the goods or services your current company is
										selling. Your reputation is of utmost importance.</p>
