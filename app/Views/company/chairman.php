									<h3>Chairman Message</h3>
									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										Dear all,<br /> Hearty Greetings to the NES Family. We feel
										fairly contented that the policy of 'For the students, of the
										students and by the students' led in the year 1965 at the time
										of institutional establishment is being continued for more
										than past half centenary. Affixing ourselves with the vision,
										'Converting knowledge into wisdom', and marching in the light
										of the mission, 'To provide study facilities to acquire
										knowledge of high quality; and to raise self-confidence and
										courage to face challenges in life', we at NES, strive for the
										overall welfare of our students. At present, we offer more
										than 30 academic programs encompassing humanities, sciences,
										technologies, skills and services to culture the learners for
										the multifaceted walks of life. Keeping in touch with the
										third and technologic generation of learners, the recent
										introduction of the master's course in digital business
										management, the only one in Maharashtra, stands as an example.
									</p>
									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										Obviously, the endeavor is more to come. In the upcoming
										technological era, we must upgrade ourselves in teaching and
										learning methods, in disciplines we offer and in counselling
										the students to cope up with both the forthcoming challenges
										and opportunities. I, with the consent and cooperation of all
										my governing colleagues, the teaching and non-teaching staff,
										assure to the parents and the society by large, that we, at
										NES, will altruistically and solely devote ourselves for the
										betterment of the student fraternity. The suggestions and
										support are always a welcome.</p>
