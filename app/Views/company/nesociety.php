									<p class="text-black"
										style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">The Beginning, In
										the year 1964, Chiplun was a small town with population of
										hardly 10,000 to 12,000. It is situated at the foothills of
										Sahyadri Mountain in Ratnagiri district and known as
										Parashuram Bhumi. Chiplun had the history of being the trade
										centre from olden days when most of the trading was done
										through sea and further material was carried to Karad,
										Kolhapur etc. by bullock carts along Sahyadri ghats. Chiplun
										could not maintain its position as an important trade centre
										when road transportation got more importance. The whole of the
										Ratnagiri district was notified as backward area.</p>

									<p class="text-black"
										style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">To start an
										educational institution under such circumstances was a
										Herculean task. There was no higher education centre nearby
										Chiplun. Either students had to go to faraway places like
										Bombay, Pune, Ratnagiri or to discontinue their education
										after matriculation. In the year 1964, under the able
										leadership of late Raosaheb Khatu, some eminent lawyers,
										doctors and merchants of Chiplun and surrounding area, thought
										of providing higher education to the underprivileged people of
										this area. Most of them were members of managing committee of
										Parashuram Education Society, which was running United English
										School in Chiplun. But they were unable to collect Rs.
										25,000/- security money to start the institution within
										stipulated time period. The dreame came true when Ms. Manorama
										Datar, a native of Chiplun encouraged her husband Dr. G. N.
										Datar, an eminent medical practitioner from Karad to donate
										Rs. 1 Lac to start Dr. G. N. Datar Science Arts and Commerce
										College at Chiplun in the year 1965.</p>

									<p class="text-black"
										style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">To start with, the
										college was sheltered in two to three rooms of Parashuram
										Education Society U. E. School. In earlier years, our students
										were mostly employed and those who had discontinued their
										education after matriculation hence they used to be from
										higher age group.</p>
									<h4>The Aim and Objective of the society:-</h4>
									<p class="text-black"
										style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">Create a
										stimulating and responsible learning environment in Computer
										Science field. We are also proactively engaged in creative and
										athletic pursuits which are mobilized through student clubs
										and associations compassing diverse activities like IT Quizs,
										S/W competitions, paper presentations and research</p>

									<h4>Distinct Features :-</h4>

										<li style="width: 90%; line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">Imparting
											literary, scientific, technical and commercial education
											along with training of teachers in Chiplun and elsewhere.</li>
										<li style="width: 90%; line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">Initially
											institution was thinking of starting primary schools, high
											schools in and around Chiplun. P. E. Society and N. E.
											Society were working hand in hand for the cause of education.</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
									<p class="text-black"
										style="line-height: 25px; font-size: 15px">Many of the
										management members were common and there was an unwritten
										memorandum of understanding: N. E. Society to concentrate on
										collegiate and higher education and P. E. Society to
										concentrate on preprimary, primary and secondary education.</p>
