									<h3>Pricipal Message</h3>
									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										Dear Students, <br /> We meet at several occasions, right from
										admission meetings, fresher parties, classroom meets,
										sometimes for addressing complaints, at curricular and
										co-curricular greeting moments, the annual social to farewells
										and so on. We both learn through these meets and add to each
										other's experiences. I attempt to share with you my
										understanding about intelligent, successful and happy life
										while you tell me what additional can be done for you. You
										also add new words to my vocabulary and keep me updated and
										youthful through sustained sharing from you. I express my
										appreciation for all this, to you.
									</p>
									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										This is a web meet. An Indirect and a broadcasting meet. In
										the current IT era such a meet is obvious. In addition to such
										meets, the era has given many tools like cellphones, social
										media at our disposal. At this juncture, with reference to
										these tools, I appeal you for an intelligent and prudent use
										of the Internet and Communication Technology. To get severally
										benefitted, you should command the tools and not let the tools
										to dictate you.</p>

									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										May I share one more crucial advice for a happy and successful
										life.Be sure that the future world demands professional
										skills. Young Indians with soft skills in linguistics, IT,
										counseling and with hard skills like nursing, electronics etc.
										have a world over call. To respond, acquire and master at
										least one of such skills along with your current education.
										Many such courses are waiting for you in the campus</p>

									<p
										style="color: #222; font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
										So, be opportunistic and successful.<br/> See you again.</p>
